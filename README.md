=========================================================================

Hey Friends, 
Daily , I see so many developers missing to enforce good password policy,
This Application can be used by normal users to generate strong password or the developers to integrate it in their web application :) 




I strongly recommond ADMIN's using this because i see lot of admin:admin or password:password as login credentials ! 
So sad, Giving the hacker a chance to hack your website using some lame security issue like BRUTEFORCE...
